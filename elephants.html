                <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                <p>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and orrder proboscidea.
                    Two species are traditionally recognised, the african elephant (Loxodonta africana)
                    and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some edvidence suggests that
                    African bish elephants and African forest elephants are separate species(L. africana and L. cyclotis
                    respectively).
                    Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elphantidae
                    is only surviving
                    family of the order Proboscidae; other now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres,
                    gomphotheres, mommoths, and mastodons.
                    Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrail animals and can reach a height of 4m
                    (13ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).
                </p>
                <p>All elephants have several distitive features, the most notable og which is a long
                    trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping
                    objects. Their incisors grow into
                    into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large
                    ear flaps helps to control their
                    temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their weight. African elephants have larger ears and
                    concave backs while Asian elephants
                    have smaller ears and convex or level backs.
                </p>
                <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forest,
                    deserts, marshes. They prefer to stay near water.
                </p>

                </strong>
                <P>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</P>
