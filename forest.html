                <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
                <p>
                      The <strong>Lost Forest</strong> is a hidden gem tucked inside Pine City Zoo, 
                      a peaceful, leafy escape where nature meets relaxation. Designed for families, 
                      friends, and solo wanderers alike, this green sanctuary offers a chance to unwind, 
                      recharge, and enjoy the beauty of the outdoors in a calm, safe, and inviting space.
                </p>

                   With its shaded trees, winding paths, and soft natural sounds, Lost Forest creates the perfect 
                   atmosphere to take a break from the busier parts of the zoo. Parents can enjoy a quiet coffee while 
                   children explore nearby play zones. Couples can stroll along the peaceful walkways, while groups of friends 
                   can find a comfortable spot to sit, chat, and laugh together. The area features forest-inspired art, nature-themed benches, 
                   and gentle background music to enhance the experience. Whether youâ€™re sipping a cool drink, taking memorable photos, or simply 
                   listening to the birds, Lost Forest is where moments slow down and memories grow.
